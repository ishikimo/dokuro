# DokuroBot

## A simple discord.js bot!

### Disclaimer:
I'm not currently adding an invite link here as the bot is not hosted 24/7. If you want to run this bot it requires node.js, discord.js, and discord.js-commando. Pretty sure that's it. Email me with any issues: mo@2g1.org.

### Features
Okay so at the current moment there aren't too many things, as the bot is very new. Right now I've added three main commands along with the commando defaults. These commands are: 

| Command | What it does |
| --- |--- |
| !d6 | Rolls a six-sided die |
| !d20 | Rolls a twenty-sided die |
| !say | Repeats whatever message the user supplies and delete's the user's command. |
